## Ufp Script Commands

ufp uses npm script block to define shortcuts for common project functions

## Installing/Updating project package.json

although each command can be called using the complete node_modules path it is
recommendet to import the script commands into the current project, which is done
using the following command

        node node_modules/ufp-core/ext/UpdatePackageJson

after that it can be triggered again - e.g. in case of core updates - using

        npm run ufp-update

### ufp-start [development]

Starts the webpack dev server and provides the application under [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
    
    tl;dr: the webpack configuration is setup for a /src folder in the project,
    using ufp-runtime configuration objects to setup redux store application

### ufp-lint:fix [development]

Linting plays a special role in the ufp- setup, the linting is buildin to the webpack loader, so it will complain about various code style issues that are preconfigured in ufp-core. The ufp-lint script command is what makes it visible on commandline and using the :fix option most of the issues can be fixed easily. Nevertheless here is the documentation on how to perform on that area
